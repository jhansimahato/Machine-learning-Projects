What is a recommender system?

A recommender system is a type of software or algorithm designed to suggest
items to users based on various types of data. This is used to enhance users
experience by providing personalised recommendations. 


Types of recommender system:

1. Content based   2. collaborative filtering based  3. Hybrid


1. CONTENT_BASED_FILTERING
This approach recommends items similar to those a user has liked in the 
past. It relies on the features of the items themselves 
(e.g., genre, actors, or keywords in articles) and compares them to find
 similarities.


2. COLLABORATIVE FILTERING BASED
This method recommends items based on the preferences of similar users. There are two main types:
User-based Collaborative Filtering: Recommends items that similar users have liked.
Item-based Collaborative Filtering: Recommends items similar to 
those a user has liked, based on how other users rated them.
